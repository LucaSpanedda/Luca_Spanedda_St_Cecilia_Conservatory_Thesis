	doi = {10.1093/ml/gcx052},
	abstract = {In his Théorie de l’information et perception esthétique (1958), the sociologist of culture Abraham Moles (1920–1992) set out to demonstrate the applicability of information theory—a mathematical linchpin of cybernetics—to the arts more generally. Moles drew on classical psychophysics, Gestalt psychology, more modern behavioral psychology, and contemporary psychoacoustic research to advocate a cybernetic model of the perception and creation of art. Moles repeatedly returned to musical examples therein to make his case, leveraging his dual expertise in philosophy and electroacoustics, drawing on formative experiences with Pierre Schaeffer in Paris and Hermann Scherchen at his Gravesano studio. Moles’s interdisciplinary text found many attentive readers across Europe and, following an English translation by the precocious Joel E. Cohen (1966), the Anglophone academic world, but was valued more as an inspiration for the burgeoning area of “information aesthetics” than as a source of hard scientific evidence. Drawing lightly on positions in the history and philosophy of science articulated by Gaston Bachelard (who supervised Moles’s second PhD, in philosophy) and Hans-Jörg Rheinberger suggests a change of emphasis away from its apparent scientific infelicities and toward Moles’s use of sound-studio technique, which is described with reference to the technologies available to Moles in the years leading up to the publication of the Théorie. Moles manipulated and processed sound recordings—filtering, clipping, and reversing them—in his attempts to empirically estimate the relative proportions of semantic and aesthetic information in speech and music. Moles’s text, when understood in tandem with the traces of his practical experiments in the sound studio, appears as an influential and occasionally prescient exposition of the many possible applications of the principles of information theory to the production, perception, and consumption of sound culture, that makes ready use of the latest technical innovations in the media environment of its time.},

These were obtained by varying the parameters of the physical circuit and of systems derived from it. Here, we present a novel class of computational system that does not respect the classical constraints in Chua's circuit, and that generates chaotic dynamics via an iterative process based on discrete versions of the equations for Chua's circuit and its variants. We call these systems Chua Machines. After presenting the chaotic dynamics, we provide a formal description of Chua Machines and a Gallery of 222 3D images, illustrating their dynamics. We discuss the method used to discover these systems and the metrics applied in the exploration of their parameter space and offer examples of highly complex bifurcation maps, together with images showing how patterns can evolve with time, or vary significantly changing the values of one of the parameters. Finally, we present a detailed analysis of qualitative changes in a Chua Machine as it traverses the parameter space of the bifurcation map. The evidence suggests that these dynamics are even richer and more complex than their counterpart in the continuous domain.},

In the present essay, I try to illustrate the shaping up of Gabor’s quantum analysis of sound, especially as delineated in two papers from 1946 (Theory of communication) and 1947 (Acoustical quanta and the theory of hearing), and to overview its legacy in scientific research as well as in audio and musical applications. After some introductory remarks, I follow a hybrid path, between history of science and history of audio technology, sketching a “genealogy” of Gabor’s quantum view of sound (i.e. as connected to Heisenberg’s indeterminacy principle, to Mach’s analysis of sensation, etc.), and relating it to an empiricist tradition of modern science. I eventually situate his research in the context of contemporary research preoccupations shared by other, at the time, and I finally discuss some of the earliest audio devices that seem to tie back to Gabor’s own practical experiments (beside his theoretical framework) and that revealed of primary interest to pioneers in analog and digital music technologies and related creative practices.},

              (AESI) project. It starts with a discussion of the paradigm of ‘interaction’ in existing computer music and live electronics approaches, and develops following bio-cybernetic principles such as ‘system/ambience coupling’, ‘noise’, and ‘self-organisation’. Central to the paper is an understanding of ‘interaction’ as a network of interdependencies among system components, and as a means for dynamical behaviour to emerge upon the contact of an autonomous system (e.g. a DSP unit) with the external environment (room or else hosting the performance). The author describes the design philosophy in his current work with the AESI (whose DSP component was implemented as a signal patch in K
              YMA
              5.2), touching on compositional implications (not only live electronics situations, but also sound installations).},

	abstract = {The ever-increasing focus on sound in recent creative practices has ideological implications and seems to reframe and problematise ontological perspectives on music. Today it is possible to contrast notions of music as identical with sound (as in the discursive framework of ‘audio culture’) with artistic practices where sound and music are
              not at all
              identical, and the usually implicit hierarchy between them is probably twisted. This article discusses such matters from a methodological position that weaves together issues usually discussed in different areas of concern: it understands ecologically informed notions of sound and auditory experience as strictly intertwined with critical and inventive attitudes on technology, particularly as their intertwining is elaborated through performative practices. It suggests that, in music as well as in sound art, what we hear
              as
              sound and
              in
              sound is the dynamics of an
              ecology of situated and mediated actions
              , as a process that binds together (1) human beings (practitioners and listeners, their auditory inclinations), (2) technical agencies (the domain where means and ends are dialectically negotiated as practitioners strive to achieve a certain freedom in action across the public space of technological mediations and delegations) and (3) the environment (the physical
              and
              cultural context where sound-making and listening practices take place). The general idea is that the manners by which we shape up our relationship to sound and appropriate the technical mediations involved in working with it, are of
              biopolitical
              relevance for social endeavours that might (still) be ‘music’},

	abstract = {Scholars have explored the influence of the field of cybernetics on scientific thought and disciplines. However, from the inception of the field, ‘‘cyberneticians’’ had explicitly envisioned applications reaching beyond the purview of scientific disciplines; cybernetics was remarkable for its portability and potential application in a wide variety of contexts. This article explores connections between cybernetics and experimental music from 1950-1980, which was a period of experimentation with electronic techniques in recording, composition, and sound production and manipulation. Examples include musicians, engineers, instrument builders, composers, and scientists in collaboration with musicians who invoked cybernetic themes in their work. These uses of cybernetics were more diverse than accounts of cybernetics within the sciences suggest, presenting a major difficulty in addressing cybernetics as a homogeneous or monolithic discourse. In particular, cybernetic discourse in music often exhibited themes of openness and indeterminacy, rather than the ‘‘command and control’’ of the ‘‘closed world.’’},

A discussion of the integration of cybernetics and chaos is offered. The shared characteristics of cybernetics and chaos are examined, and a new model of communication called cyberchaos is proposed. The ten principles of cyberchaos are discussed.

While nobody could anticipate the complexities that developed since, Ashby's idea of understanding complex systems in terms of manageable interactions, which I call electronic artefacts, is actually practised today and cyberspace is again worth analysing in information theoretical terms.},

	abstract = {This paper is an overview of the author's ongoing reflections on the need for a new paradigm of complexity capable of informing all theories, whatever their field of application or the phenomena in question. Beginning with a critique of General System Theory and the principle of holism with which it is associated, the author suggests that contemporary advances in our knowledge of organization call for a radical reformation in our organization of knowledge. This reformation involves the mobilization of recursive thinking, which is to say a manner of thinking capable of establishing a dynamic and generative feedback loop between terms or concepts (such as whole and part, order and disorder, observer and observed, system and ecosystem, etc.) that remain both complementary and antagonistic. The paradigm of complexity thus stands as a bold challenge to the fragmentary and reductionistic spirit that continues to dominate the scientific enterprise.},

            This article presents recent outcomes of the author's research on musical complex adaptive systems (CASs). The first part focuses on the concepts of adaptation and complexity within the framework of CASs and suggests a rigorous placing of the concepts within the musical domain. This analysis involves a distinction of the notions of context and information between the engineering field of information theory and the philosophical one of radical constructivism. I conclude this section by showing that, in this approach, information and context are mutually determining.
            Then, I introduce a technique related to the notion of evolvability in biology and genetic algorithms and that has significantly increased the complexity and long-term variety in music systems during autonomous evolutions. This technique distributes adaptation across higher levels and allows the system to reorganize the relationships among its agents and their structure circularly while interpreting and constructing its context.
            To conclude, an autonomous live performance piece from 2019–2020, “Constructing Realities (Homage to Heinz von Foerster),” which implements the theories mentioned above, is described, showing DSP processes and techniques that relate to evolvability, autopoiesis, fitness, and complexity through agent-based modeling.

            In this paper, we present a set of time-domain algorithms for the low- and high-level analysis of audio streams. These include spectral centroid, noisiness, and spectral spread for the low level, and dynamicity, heterogeneity, and complexity for the high level. The low-level algorithms provide a continuous measure of the features and can operate with short analysis frames. The high-level algorithms, on the other hand, are original designs informed both perceptually and by complexity theory for the analysis of musically meaningful information, both in short sounds or articulated streams with long-term nontrivial variations.
            These algorithms are suitable for the implementation of real-time audio analysis in diverse live performance setups that require the extraction of information from several streams at the same time. For example, the low-level algorithms can be deployed in large audio networks of adaptive agents, or in small-to-large ensembles for the analysis of various characteristics of the instruments for computer-assisted performance. Furthermore, the high-level algorithms can be implemented as part of fitness functions in music systems based on evolutionary algorithms that follow musically-informed criteria, or as analysis tools to assess the quality of some of the characteristics of a musical output.
            Musical applications of these algorithms can be found in a companion paper in this issue of Computer Music Journal: “Complex Adaptation in Audio Feedback Networks for the Synthesis of Music and Sounds.”},

	abstract = {The use of recursive time-variant networks for musical applications dates back to the 1960s with the seminal work of Gordon Mumma who implemented his own systems and circuits in the analogue domain. Practitioners like Nicolas Collins followed the same approach in the 1970s – particularly with works such as Pea Soup (1976) – and, in more modern times, this technique has been extended to the digital domain and thoroughly explored by composers such as Agostino Di Scipio and the author. The general framework for this approach is to establish several interdependent relationships among the information which is extracted from sound and the variables which affect sound itself, while also creating a structural coupling, i.e. a feedback loop, between information and sound processing. This configuration is the basis for the realisation of systems which can adapt – very broadly speaking – to the context they operate in, and that, under the right circumstances and implementations, can exhibit a complex autonomous behaviour, albeit maintaining a convincing variety over a long time span is a particularly challenging goal. The work presented here is based on a novel idea developed by the author, that is a time-variant network where the relationships between information and sound processing are themselves time-variant and context-dependent, resulting in a dynamical adaptivity, with the scope of enhancing the long-term variety and complexity of autonomous music systems. The author, after a discussion on adaptive systems which is necessary to better contextualise the conceptual and technical framework of the work, will proceed through a description of the system while providing connections to the artistic ideas and implications of this approach on the practice of live performance with autonomous systems.},

	abstract = {Cybernetics was formulated by its founders as a metadiscipline with the aim, not only of fostering collaboration between disciplines (interdisciplinarity), but also of sharing knowledge across disciplines (transdisciplinarity). As a metadiscipline, cybernetics comments on forms of knowing (the cognitive processes and communicative practices of observers) and also on forms of knowledge (for example, similarities and differences between different discipline areas). This article presents cybernetic models of “coming to know” and of “knowledge sharing.” The distinction between first and second order forms of cybernetics is introduced to mark the reflexive nature of cybernetics as a metadiscipline. There is then a discussion of the first order study of natural systems, noting in particular: • the emergent discovered properties of such domains; • the role played by the observer’s a priori assumptions and decisions about what to study and how to study. This is followed by a discussion of cybernetics and the social sciences. Here the distinction between first and higher order forms of cybernetics is brought into play in order to characterize: • studies of social systems and social behaviour that adopt classical scientific modes of investigation; • studies that investigate the interactions of social actors; • approaches that attempt to characterize social systems as distinct forms of autonomous whole. Finally there is a discussion of how the metadisciplinary perspective of cybernetics can help inform and enlighten the “other than science” domains of knowledge and activity known as the arts, the humanities, the vocational disciplines and philosophy.},

Von Foerster’s distinction, together with his own work on the epistemology of the observer, has been enormously inﬂuential on the work of a later generation of cyberneticians. It has provided an architecture for the discipline of cybernetics, one that, in true cybernetic spirit, provides order where previously there was variety and disorder. It has provided a foundation for the research programme that is second-order cybernetics. However, as von Foerster himself makes clear, the distinction he articulated was imminent right from the outset in the thinking of the early cyberneticians, before, even, the name of their discipline had been coined. In this paper, the author gives a brief account of the developments in cybernetics that lead to von Foerster’s making his distinction. As is the way of such narratives, it is but one perspective on a complex series of events. Not only is this account a personal perspective, it also includes some recollections of events that were observed and participated in at ﬁrst hand.},

E' questo un approccio diverso da quello prevalente sul tema dei modelli fisici, il quale si è finora piuttosto proposto di ottenere una migliore "riproduzione" con mezzi elettronici degli strumenti tradizionali. Vengono inoltre presentate le differenze fondamentali nell'uso musicale tra i modelli fisici e i più tradizionali modelli di segnale (sintesi additiva, sottrattiva, FM, ecc.). Con i modelli fisici (secondo l'approccio utilizzato al CRM), si hanno a disposizione, infatti, parametri tempo-variabili in diretta relazione con quelli dell'oggetto fisico responsabile della generazione del suono. I musicisti possono così realizzare condizioni di emissione e controllo del suono "irrealizzabili", continuando però a restare nell'ambito di modalità intuibili o immaginabili in una rappresentazione mentale "fisica" dell'oggetto concreto, anziché astrattamente del segnale (suono) stesso.

	abstract = {This paper discusses the possibility of analysing (in the musical meaning of the word) Agostino Di Scipio’s “audible ecosystems”. A first part is focused on the notion of audible ecosystem and its theoretical counterpart, the idea of emergent sound structures. With this last idea, high levels of a musical work (for instance, the macroform itself) appear as an emergence from lower levels. As for the notion of audible ecosystem – analyzed here through the live electronics solos named Audible Ecosystemics – it is achieved through interaction between the performer, the electronics and the environment. Then, the paper tries to define an analytic image of the resultant sounds of the audible ecosystems. To do so, we use the concept of imprint (empreinte in French) as it is analyzed by Georges Didi-Huberman. Then, we go back to musical analysis and argue that a musical analysis of Agostino Di Scipio’s audible ecosystems involves an analysis of the relationships between what we have listened to, what we can only imagine and the compositional techniques. Before concluding, the article shows an example of this way of analyzing by taking a sample at random from the piece Audible Ecosystemics 3b.},

Oltre alle analisi in tempo differito che richiedono di prendere in considerazione l’intera lunghezza del segnale su cui si effettua l’analisi, oggi è possibile operare alcune di queste analisi in tempo reale grazie ad alcuni linguaggi di programmazione. In questa ricerca andremo ad utilizzare il linguaggio di programmazione Faust (GRAME) per il tempo reale e la libreria di Python pyACA per il tempo differito, al fine di condurre un'analisi sperimentale su alcuni effetti Larsen generati all’interno di una stanza.},

	abstract = {Chaotic signals are useful in two different levels in audio synthesis: as sound material or control structure. Patching languages such as Pd, Max/MSP, and jMAX provide easier mechanisms for generating chaotic structures at control level. We can generate deterministic chaotic signals either by ﬁnding numerical solutions to differential equations or by using ﬁrst return maps. While generating the next sample, both of these methods require calculations with the knowledge of the previous sample. Most signal processing environments for computer music, such as Pd, Max/MSP, and jMAX, transfer audio data among their objects by vectors (blocks). In such environments, ﬁnding numerical solutions to differential equations or generating signals based on ﬁrst return maps, will require writing external objects or setting the block-size to 1. Writing external objects can be time consuming and the real-time control of the calculations have to be embedded in the external object, which will require a recompilation for every change to the mechanism. Setting the block-size to 1 can make writing the patch cumbersome and sometimes very confusing. In this paper we shall present the fexpr∼ object, implemented for Pd, Max/MSP, and jMAX, which can be used for ﬁnding numerical solutions to differential equations by simply entering the difference equations as part of the object arguments. The object parameters can then be controlled in real-time using the host patching language. As examples, solutions to Lorenz Equations, Chua’s Oscillators, Dufﬁng’s equation, and the use of ﬁrst return maps will be presented using the fexpr∼ object.},

The synthesis process is described and the project is related both to prior work on chaotic synthesis and to relevant perspectives from physical modelling. A range of specific kinds of interactions with the synthesis engine are considered, supported by accompanying videos. These interactions demonstrate the complexity of behaviours that can be encountered when interacting with chaotic systems, particularly in relation to hysteresis. The potential of the system to enter different states, and for unstable boundary points to be explored as creative resources are considered and linked to Andy Keep’s notion of instrumentalizing.},

The system developed consists of an open-source graphical tool and a rotary forcefeedback device made from commercially available components to facilitate the authoring of audiohaptic applications. The system’s requirements are collected through a background analysis: I review related research in force-feedback DMI’s to motivate the capabilities of the system and inspire musical application examples. I survey current software solutions for audio-haptic authoring to understand how the system should work. I obtain latency and stability requirements for the device by reviewing existing open-source force feedback devices and according to related literature on the performance evaluation of haptic devices. Implementing an early prototype is used to inform the development of the graphical editing tool and its integration in an embedded audio-haptic environment using the functional programming language FAUST for real-time signal processing. I implement the device with a low-cost stepper motor and compensate cogging torque for maximizing haptic transparency. The device is integrated into two DMI’s, the T-Stick, and a standalone haptic knob, and used to prototype four audio-haptic applications. I provide a technical evaluation, showing that the system meets latency and stability requirements, and provide all source code and assembly instructions as open-source available to the community.},
